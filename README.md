# DSA301 (Time Series Analytics)
This repository contains my learnings for SMU module DSA301 (Time Series Analytics).

Time series analytics is the study of ordered sequences of data points collected over time. It involves identifying patterns, trends, and seasonality, forecasting future values, detecting anomalies, and using statistical methods for analysis. Common applications include predicting stock prices, weather patterns, and optimizing resource allocation. Visualizing data and employing decision support techniques are integral parts of time series analytics.
