# DSA301 (Time Series Analytics)
This repository contains my __homework and project__ for SMU module DSA301 (Time Series Analytics).

# Project description
*Climate change, Human-caused or not?*

Long-term climate change research has been modelled as an interaction between the following 3 variables: 
1. greenhouse gas emissions
2. global average temperatures
3. Sea levels
   
Other indicators (either causal factors or outcomes) have been proposed, such as deforestation, droughts & species extinction. Our project seeks to help uncover the effects of anthropogenic activities on climate change,

# R
ts_hw.R are my homework R scripts.
