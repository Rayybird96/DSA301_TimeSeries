# DSA301 (Time Series Analytics)
This repository contains my learnings for SMU module DSA301 (Time Series Analytics).

Time series analytics is the study of ordered sequences of data points collected over time. It involves identifying patterns, trends, and seasonality, forecasting future values, detecting anomalies, and using statistical methods for analysis. Common applications include predicting stock prices, weather patterns, and optimizing resource allocation. Visualizing data and employing decision support techniques are integral parts of time series analytics.

# Description of R files
These are the R files that help faciliate and track my learning process week by week. There will be minimal application here and mostly theory/learning of concepts. To see application and analytics in play, please refer to my project file.

# TODO: Add project file when project starts
